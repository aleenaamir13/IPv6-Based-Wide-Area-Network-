# IPv6-Based Wide Area Network with OSPF Routing

## Abstract  
This project explores the implementation of **IPv6 addressing** and **Open Shortest Path First (OSPFv3)** routing in a hierarchical network topology. The topology consists of **core and edge routers**, switches, and end devices. The goal is to evaluate the **efficiency, scalability, and simplicity** of OSPF in an IPv6 environment while analyzing **routing performance, address configuration, and topology structure**. Both **software simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)** and **hardware implementation** were tested.

## Introduction  
Due to the **depletion of IPv4 addresses**, IPv6 has become essential for modern networking. IPv6 provides:  
- Vast address space  
- Improved scalability  
- Enhanced security features  
- Support for IoT and mobile ecosystems  

This project designs and implements an IPv6 WAN with **OSPFv3 routing**, using a **three-layer hierarchical topology (Core, Distribution, Access)** to ensure **structured design, scalability, and efficient management**.

## Tools & Resources  
### Software  
- Cisco Packet Tracer  

### Hardware  
- 2 IPv6 Routers  
- 2 Switches  
- 3 End Devices  

---

## Topology Design  
The topology follows a **three-layer hierarchical model**:  

1. **Core Layer**  
   - Routers (Router6 & Router8) interconnect network branches.  
   - Provides high-speed backbone communication.  
   - (Skipped in hardware due to limited devices).  

2. **Distribution Layer**  
   - Edge routers (Router7 & Router9).  
   - Aggregate subnets and apply policies (e.g., QoS, filtering).  

3. **Access Layer**  
   - Switches and end devices (PCs, Laptops).  
   - Provides user connectivity.  

This separation simplifies **management, scalability, troubleshooting, and fault tolerance**.

## IPv6 Addressing  
The project uses **Global Unicast Addressing (GUA)** for:  
- Global connectivity  
- Unique addressing (no conflicts)  
- End-to-end communication (no NAT required)  
- Scalability for future expansion  
- Efficient routing with OSPFv3 compatibility  
- Real-world implementation and secure communication with IPsec

## OSPFv3 Routing  
### Why OSPFv3?  
- Dynamic route updates  
- High scalability  
- Fast convergence  
- Native IPv6 support  

### Configuration Steps  
1. Assign IPv6 addresses to routers and end devices.  
2. Enable OSPFv3 on router interfaces.  
3. Verify using `show ipv6 route`.  
4. Test connectivity with `ping` between end devices.  

---

## Results & Observations  
- **Routing Performance**: OSPFv3 quickly converged with minimal downtime.  
- **Addressing**: IPv6 avoided conflicts and simplified configuration.  
- **Traffic Flow**: Hierarchical design optimized traffic handling.  
- **Scalability**: Additional devices integrated seamlessly.  
- **Hardware Limitation**: Full core layer could not be implemented physically due to lack of routers/cables.  

---

## Conclusion  
This project demonstrates that **IPv6 with OSPFv3** in a hierarchical topology ensures:  
- **Scalability**  
- **Reliability**  
- **Efficient routing**  
- **Enterprise-grade design**  

Despite hardware constraints, the **Cisco Packet Tracer simulation** fully validated the network design and routing functionality.
